# PlantCare
## Description
This is my team's submission for MacHacks3, one of the only AI/ML hackathons in North America! Millions of people around the world pick up gardening, whether that be to
grow their own food, make a positive impact on the environment, or just for fun. However, gardening can be extremely daunting to newcomers, and many of their first 
few plants will end up dying due to lack of knowledge on how to properly care of it. My team solves that problem with PlantCare, as users can upload pictures of their
plants and our app will tell them how to care for it, providing them with info on their plant's preferred temperatures, watering schedule, and tolerated light.
